Top Scores Problem Definition:
Suppose in a mobile app game, a player receives a score between 0 - 100 each round. Given a list of player scores, design an algorithm that sorts the list faster than O(nlogn).

Solution:
The function fastsort(highest_possible_score, unsorted_scores) in TopScores.py sorts the list in O(n) time and space.
